# The Isle | EVIRMA Server Manager
Windows based server manager for running the isle evrima servers and managing them as you wish. Unfortunatekly the dev's of this game seem to have no care in the world for people spinning up unoffical servers and wanting to maintain and enjoy them. I made this tool for folks that want to do exactly that.
## Features
* Automated requirement installs outside of the server binary
* Game settings adjustments with the ability to restart the server after - wipes config if changes made while server is running (dev feature I'd guess)
* User management for Admins, VIPs and Whitelists
* Togglable resource monitor via the GUI
* Scheduled RCON tasks within the manager itself
* Automated update checking for the manager as well as game server
* Customizable install locations for game server (defaults to manager directory)
* Server console direct into the manager console box
* Customizable alerts based on entries the server console outputs during runtime

## Possible Upcoming Features
* Dino storage - ability to save dino's per player once safely logged out
* Web based management system for deploying and managing multiple server instances running the manager
  * Optimzed manager stubs for web based deployments
  * Linux manager stub
* Linux manager standlaone - console app of course
* You're always welcome to submit ideas in the Issues tab - no guarantees on the ideas though, unless you code and make a PR to review and test

## Donations - if you want
* Help with code would be nice
